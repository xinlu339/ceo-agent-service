# WeChat Personal-Account Channel — Operations

Status: the local personal-account receive/read/decide/send pipeline is implemented
and verified on this Mac. Sending remains disabled by default in repository
configuration, while this deployment explicitly enables automatic sending. Both
feasibility gates are proven (see
[research doc](wechat-channel-and-local-memory-research.md) and the plan's Task 4/5/10
correction blocks): local-DB read (1.72M messages decrypted, 0 HMAC failures) and
Accessibility send (verified live to 文件传输助手, including background queue status
`sent` followed by an exact outbound database readback).

## What is implemented (`app/wechat/`)

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `models.py` | Immutable channel contracts + trigger validation |
| `discovery.py` / `snapshot.py` | Account/DB discovery; read-only snapshots |
| `key_provider.py` | Passphrase provider boundary (blocked / persisted file) |
| `cipher.py` / `schema.py` / `backend.py` | SQLCipher-4 decrypt (passphrase→PBKDF2), zstd, `Msg_<md5>`/`Name2Id`/`contact.db` parsing, decrypted mirror |
| `reader.py` | Capability-gated normalized reads |
| `producer.py` | Eligible-message → channel-isolated reply task (exact group @-gate) |
| `prompt.py` / `consumer.py` | WeChat-specific prompt + tool-free Pi decision → fail-closed delivery; the schema-validated reply transport marker maps to WeChat delivery, while every other system action is rejected |
| `accessibility.py` | Exact-once delivery state machine + real AX runner |
| `sender_ipc.py` / `sender_helper.py` | Owner-only IPC client/server and dedicated signed Sender app entrypoint |
| `memory_import.py` / `memory_writer.py` | Bounded extraction + deterministic cleanup; claimed, approved-only Memory writer (`memory.py` keeps public imports) |
| `setup.py` / `audit_web.py` | Tutorial connect service + visible contact/group picker |
| `service.py` / `cli.py` | Composable steps/loops + diagnostic CLI |
| `scripts/wechat_key_probe.py` | Fingerprint-only key/schema gate |

Store isolation: `reply_tasks`/`reply_attempts`/`sent_replies` gain a `channel`
column (default `dingtalk`); claims are channel-filtered so the DingTalk worker
never claims WeChat work. New tables: `wechat_read_state`,
`wechat_reply_scopes`, `wechat_deliveries`, `wechat_memory_candidates`.

## One-time key capture (SIP stays on, real app untouched)

See `~/wx_read_toolkit/README.md`. Summary: shadow-copy WeChat → re-sign the copy
(`get-task-allow`, strip Hardened Runtime) → `capture_driver.py` breakpoints
`CCKeyDerivationPBKDF` → log out/in → the 32-byte passphrase is validated against
`message_0.db` and saved to `~/.config/wx_read/passphrase.hex` (chmod 600). The
passphrase is account-stable; re-capture only after logout/reinstall.

## Dedicated Reader permission boundary

The production reader is the dedicated **CEO WeChat Reader** executable with a
fixed bundle identifier and stable signing identity. Only that helper receives
App Data permission; it returns normalized, bounded results to the main service
over a local authenticated IPC interface, so the main Python service never opens
the WeChat database. Granting App Data / Full Disk Access to a shared Python
interpreter is neither required nor recommended. First authorization remains an
explicit local user action; zero-click deployment requires managed macOS/MDM
privacy policy.

### Reader runtime resilience

The Reader owns one mutable decrypted mirror, so database operations are
serialized inside the helper; health checks remain independent. A source shard
change may require decrypting tens or hundreds of megabytes before the query can
run, therefore the IPC timeout defaults to 120 seconds
(`CEO_WECHAT_READER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) rather than 5 seconds.

On 2026-07-22 the previous 5-second timeout was confirmed to cause client
disconnects, `BrokenPipeError` in the helper, and repeated
`wechat-producer stopped unexpectedly` notifications. Runtime handling now
distinguishes the two cases:

- a transient socket refusal or timeout records `wechat_reader_unavailable`,
  waits for the normal polling interval, and retries automatically;
- an explicit `permission_required` response records
  `wechat_data_permission_required` and pauses that loop until service restart,
  preventing repeated macOS permission prompts and background load.

Do not treat every IPC timeout as revoked App Data permission. Confirm helper
health, the structured IPC error code, and a bounded real read before changing
TCC settings.

### Reader query latency

The Reader keeps read-only SQLite connections, contact display-name maps, and
per-shard sender-ID maps open while their corresponding encrypted source file
version is unchanged. Every request still checks source mtimes; before refreshing
a changed mirror it closes the old connection and discards the related maps.
This preserves current-message correctness without repeatedly parsing all 14
historical shard schemas. On the production-sized local mirror, the measured
in-process `probe + read_messages(limit=10)` hot path is 65–71ms after one-time
warm-up. First open and any source-change decryption remain slower by design and
must not be reported as hot-query latency.

## Dedicated Sender permission boundary

Accessibility is granted to `~/Applications/CEO WeChat Sender.app` (bundle ID
`com.stardust.ceo-agent.wechat-sender`), not to Miniforge Python or the main
launchd service. The main service calls a strict owner-only Unix socket (mode
`0600`); the helper only exposes health/preflight, target identification, bounded
text send, and best-effort recall operations. Build and install it with:

```sh
CEO_WECHAT_READER_SIGNING_IDENTITY='CEO WeChat Reader Local Signing' \
  ./scripts/build-wechat-sender-app.sh
./scripts/install-wechat-sender-app.sh
```

The stable signing identity prevents ordinary rebuilds from producing a new TCC
identity. After first install, add the dedicated app once in System Settings →
Privacy & Security → Accessibility and restart its LaunchAgent. The AX runner
resolves the actual WeChat application by bundle ID, waits for asynchronous UI
state, and navigates duplicate direct-chat names with the stable target ID before
requiring the composer title to match the expected display name. Group navigation
uses the verified unique group name.

Delivery status is mirrored back to the History `reply_attempts` row. A
`ready_to_send` or `sending` delivery remains `pending`; `sent` becomes `sent`;
user rejection becomes `skipped`; `failed` and `send_unknown` become `failed`
with the delivery error. `no_reply` and `handoff_to_human` decisions do not
create a delivery and must be recorded as `skipped`, so the audit backlog does
not retain stale WeChat `pending` attempts.

An Accessibility result that confirms no UI action occurred is different from an
ambiguous send. Only the first `action_not_performed` returns to
`ready_to_send` and is retried from the same delivery record; a second such
result remains failed with its retry count recorded. `send_unknown`, sent,
manually rejected, and target-binding failures remain outside this retry path,
so an uncertain or disallowed send is never repeated automatically.

## Diagnostic CLI

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m app.wechat.cli status                     # probe capability per account
.venv/bin/python -m app.wechat.cli read-recent --db data/auto-reply.sqlite3 --target-id filehelper --limit 100   # uses persisted self_user_id; redacted metadata
.venv/bin/python -m app.wechat.cli read-recent --db data/auto-reply.sqlite3 --target-id filehelper --include-text  # explicit local verify
.venv/bin/python -m app.wechat.cli produce-once               # scan enabled scopes → enqueue
.venv/bin/python -m app.cli wechat import-memory --db data/auto-reply.sqlite3 \
    --account-id '<ready-account-id>' --target-id '<wxid-or-chatroom-id>' \
    --since '2026-01-01' --until '2026-07-20T23:59:59+08:00' --limit 1000
.venv/bin/python scripts/wechat_key_probe.py --passphrase-file ~/.config/wx_read/passphrase.hex \
    --account-db-dir "$HOME/Library/Containers/com.tencent.xinWeChat/Data/Documents/xwechat_files/<acct>/db_storage"
```

`import-memory` is an explicit, one-shot operation. It requires exactly one
persisted `ready` account with a resolved self wxid, one or more `--target-id`
values (maximum 100), a date bound, and a total `--limit` from 1–10000. It reads
at most that limit from each target, keeps the globally newest bounded set
independent of target argument order, and sends only non-empty text messages to
the extraction runner. It reads only those local conversations, creates
cleaned `pending` rows, and never changes the automatic-reply activation
watermark or calls `memory_write`. Repeating the exact same account, targets,
bounds, and limit is idempotent.

Review the result at `/wechat/memory-review`. Each row shows the cleaned
statement, category, confidence, sensitivity, minimal redacted evidence, source
time and message/conversation IDs, cleanup notes, reviewer/time, review state,
Memory id/error, and write state. Approval is deliberately
per-row and requires an editable final statement and reviewer. Memory writing is
a second explicit action that processes only checked, already-approved IDs.
Bulk reject is available; bulk approve is not. A rejected or revoked row cannot
be written. If a previously written row is revoked, the page records
`revocation_unavailable` because the current Memory backend has no supported
delete/revoke operation; it does not claim that the Memory was removed.

The writer transactionally claims each approved row. Concurrent clicks can call
the backend at most once. A confirmed successful `memory_write` tool event and a
stable Memory id are required before `written` is recorded. Ambiguous results are
marked `unknown` and are never retried automatically; clear failures are marked
`failed` for an intentional manual retry. Extraction and review persist no raw
chat transcript, DB path, passphrase, token, or API key.
If the process crashes while a row is `writing`, an operator can use that row's
“中断写入标记为 unknown” action; it never turns the row back into an automatically
retryable state. Cross-run candidates with the same normalized statement reuse
the existing row and merge source IDs/time without resetting its review/write
state; rejected/revoked rows do not suppress a later import. Before any pending
row is created, a read-only Pi matcher is hard-limited to the reviewed
`memory_recall` tool. Exact durable-Memory matches are skipped;
compatible matches use a separately validated merged statement and remain
pending; contradictory matches retain the new statement and are flagged pending.
Every non-`none` relation must cite a Memory id and minimal evidence that are
programmatically verified against the same object in the connector's returned
`memories` list; an empty list is a successful `none` result. The recall query
is deterministic for each candidate and must match that candidate's sole audited
tool call exactly. Missing, ambiguous, unrelated, or tool-noncompliant recall
fails the import closed.
Model-provided cleanup notes are never persisted. The interrupted-write action
also requires explicit confirmation and a row that has remained `writing` for at
least 15 minutes.

## Shared-file integration status

1. ✅ **`app/setup_wizard.py`** (updated 2026-07-21) — `wechat_connection` step registered
   (Phase 3, gates only on local `preflight`, independent of optional Memory MCP,
   `service_config`, and `data_corpus`; actions `check`/`connect` only).
   `run_setup_action`/`check_setup_step` dispatch to
   `WechatSetupService` via `service.build_setup_service`. `SetupWizardEvent` gained
   `next_step_status` so a successful action leaves the step `blocked` when the
   reader is blocked.
2. ✅ **`app/audit_web.py`** (updated 2026-07-21) — Tutorial shows only Check and
   Connect WeChat as soon as preflight is complete. Config → WeChat exposes one
   combined search for friends and groups (the results carry a visible type
   label) backed by `GET /config/wechat/conversations` and
   `POST /config/wechat/reply-scope`.
   Direct chats use `every_inbound_text`; groups are fixed to
   `mention_current_account`. The page does not expose DB paths or raw messages.
3. ✅ **`app/cli.py`** (done 2026-07-18):
   - `ceo-agent wechat <status|read-recent|produce-once|consume-once>` passes
     through (argparse REMAINDER) to `app.wechat.cli`. `wechat status`
     auto-detects+persists `self_user_id` and reports `ready`.
   - `run_service()` starts `wechat-producer`/`wechat-consumer` threads only when
     `CEO_WECHAT_READER_ENABLED` **and** a single account is persisted `ready`
     with a non-empty self-wxid
     (`_wechat_service_components`); disabled by default (no effect on the DingTalk
     service). The DingTalk and WeChat producer/consumer threads run side by side,
     and a WeChat initialization failure is recorded without terminating the
     DingTalk main service. Auto-send stays gated — the loops enqueue tasks and
     produce `ready_to_send` deliveries but do not send unless every send gate passes.
   - If macOS denies access to another app's data (`EACCES`/`EPERM`), the WeChat
     loop records one `wechat_data_permission_required` error and stops until
     service restart instead of retrying every poll interval.

## History review

The main History page (`/`) exposes four object checkboxes: `replay`, `wechat`,
`task`, and `meeting`. All are selected by default. Selecting only `wechat`
filters the SQL query, count, search, and pagination to WeChat reply attempts;
selecting only `replay` shows non-WeChat reply attempts. WeChat rows carry a
green channel badge. In confirm mode, an unambiguous `ready_to_send` delivery
also shows inline send/reject actions and returns to History after the action.
The action is matched by the exact conversation and trigger-message IDs, not by
conversation alone. A WeChat History row derives its displayed status from that
delivery, so a manually rejected delivery is shown as failed rather than stale
pending.

## Controlled verification (before any live send)

1. `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` — full suite green.
2. `wechat status` → the account reports `ready`; `read-recent --include-text` on
   File Transfer Helper — compare count/order/direction/timestamp/sender/text;
   run twice, confirm `produce-once` enqueues zero duplicates on the second scan.
   `read-recent` requires exactly one account persisted as `ready`; it never falls
   back to a directory discovered on disk. If that ready row has no self-wxid, it
   probes only that account and refuses to print guessed directions on failure.
3. Decision dry-run with `CEO_WECHAT_SENDER_ENABLED=0`: one direct message → one
   task + audited decision; an ordinary group message → no task; a real
   `@current account` group message → one task; no external send.
4. Sender only after File Transfer Helper binding is `verified`: one fixed test
   reply, confirm delivery status `sent` + matching outbound DB record, restart
   before a second send and confirm no duplicate; force a post-action ambiguity
   and verify `send_unknown` pauses the target with no auto-retry. This exact
   background-queue → dedicated Sender → outbound DB readback passed on
   2026-07-21.
5. Bounded Memory import on an approved test scope → review page shows cleaned
   pending rows only; approve one, write once, write again → same Memory id, one
   tool call; reject another → cannot be written.

## Send confirmation & recall (2026-07-18)

- **Confirm vs auto** (`CEO_WECHAT_SEND_MODE`, default `confirm`): the consumer
  always produces a `ready_to_send` delivery. In **confirm** mode the sender loop
  sends **nothing** — deliveries wait for explicit approval
  (`ceo-agent wechat pending` / `approve --id N` / `reject --id N`, or
  `service.approve_wechat_delivery`/`reject_wechat_delivery`). In **auto** mode the
  `wechat-sender` loop sends them only when `CEO_WECHAT_SENDER_ENABLED=1`,
  `CEO_NOT_SEND_MESSAGE=0`, and mode is `auto`. This is the primary guard against
  a wrong/awkward send.
- **New inbound context supersedes stale unsent drafts.** Creating a delivery for
  a newer trigger in the same account and conversation atomically marks older
  `ready_to_send`, `failed`, or `send_unknown` deliveries as `superseded`; their
  attempts become `skipped`. Sent, sending, and explicitly rejected deliveries
  remain unchanged.
- **Direct-chat navigation evidence is refreshed at send time.** The normal
  low-load delay means the sidebar preview may have advanced past the message
  that originally triggered a reply. Immediately before claiming a delivery,
  the sender reads the newest records from that exact `conversation_id`, skips
  internal/non-text records that do not produce a visible text preview, and uses
  the newest usable text for the unique-sidebar-row check; the original trigger
  stays unchanged in the audit record. If the Reader is unavailable or no recent
  record has usable text, the delivery remains `ready_to_send` for a later polling
  pass and WeChat is not touched. The composer title must still match, so this
  does not fall back to display-name-only navigation.
- **Wrong-target detection is layered, not instant.** Immediate check = the AX
  binding (`chat_input_field.AXTitle == target`, twice); duplicates it cannot tell
  apart, so those rely on `binding_status=="verified"` (fail-closed). A **DB check
  by `conversation_id`** must be **delayed** (reconcile): the just-sent message
  sits in WeChat's WAL and is not in the decrypted mirror for seconds–minutes, so
  an immediate DB verify false-negatives and must **not** drive an auto-recall.
- **Recall (撤回)** is a **best-effort, unvalidated backstop**
  (`runner.recall_last_outbound(text)` → right-click bubble → 撤回; `service.
  recall_wechat_delivery`). It only works inside WeChat's ~2-minute window with the
  chat open, and reliable auto-triggering is limited (immediate wrong detection is
  hard; the DB reconcile that would catch it is past the window). Treat it as a
  manual "oops" action, not a guaranteed net — **confirm mode is the real safety.**

## Disable / rollback

- `CEO_WECHAT_READER_ENABLED=0`, `CEO_WECHAT_SENDER_ENABLED=0` (defaults) — loops
  never start.
- Purge the decrypted mirror (`CEO_WECHAT_MIRROR_DIR`, default
  `~/.cache/wx_read/plain`) and the passphrase file to remove all plaintext.
- The real `/Applications/WeChat.app` is never modified by this channel.

## Known residual risks / TODO

- **Sender** (pure-AX, reverified 2026-07-21): composes via `AXValue` set on `chat_input_field`
  and sends by posting Return to WeChat's pid (`CGEventPostToPid`) — **no focus
  steal, no synthetic typing into the frontmost app**. Selecting the target chat
  is the one step that needs WeChat briefly key: on 4.1.10 the session list rows
  are static text with empty AX action lists, background clicks don't register,
  and background keystrokes land text in the search box but WeChat won't *run* the
  search unless its window is active — so full-background nav is not possible.
  Mitigation: the sender **waits until the user has been idle** (`idle_seconds`,
  no keyboard/mouse via `CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType`) before the ~1s
  foreground, then **restores the previously-frontmost app** (`restore_focus`) —
  so it never interrupts mid-typing. Residual: needs Accessibility permission
  (cached at process launch — grant then relaunch the dedicated Sender app).
  Duplicate direct-chat display names are navigated with their stable target ID
  and then corroborated against the visible composer title; groups remain
  fail-closed on unique verified names. If the user set
  "Enter=newline", Return won't send (composer-not-cleared → fall back to ⌘Return).
- **Exact `@self` group detection** ✅ (done 2026-07-18): mentions are stored as a
  comma-separated wxid list in the message `source` column's
  `<msgsource><atuserlist>` (NOT `packed_info_data`, which is only flags). The
  reader (`schema.parse_mentions` + `backend.py`) extracts them, handling zstd
  (`WCDB_CT_source==4`); `WechatMessage.mentions_user(self_wxid)` gates group
  replies. Verified end-to-end on real data (self wxid `derek840121` matched in
  real group @-messages). Group triggers require `self_user_id` populated on the
  account so the gate has a wxid to match.
- **Direction**: real outbound/inbound needs the self-wxid; defaults inbound
  until `self_username` is populated. The diagnostic CLI now requires a resolved
  self-wxid before reading, so it cannot silently label every row inbound.
  Automatic producer, consumer, and sender loops do not start without it, and
  one-shot produce/consume commands build their reader with that persisted id.
- **Activation watermark**: each selected scope starts at its activation time;
  historical messages are never fed into auto-reply. The producer advances that
  scope only after the entire normalized batch has been handled. Producer pages
  oldest-first after the watermark while retaining every row in the watermark
  second as overlap; the unique task key removes duplicates without losing a
  same-second row that becomes visible later. Historical Memory import remains a
  separate, bounded, human-reviewed operation.
