# Product Logic

The service treats DingTalk as the primary conversation surface and keeps
retrieval, generation, audit, and feedback local.

## Input

Each worker pass asks `dws` for unread conversations. For each conversation it
reads:

- recent context before the unread cursor
- unread messages after the cursor
- linked DingTalk documents when a message contains an Alidocs URL

Direct chats are treated as addressed to the configured principal. Group chats
must explicitly mention the principal before they become candidates.

## Decision

The worker stores one batch of unread messages as a generation-aware task and
starts one Pi Direct Agent run. Pi returns a strict terminal result: completed,
no action, needs human, or failed. Reply text and any confirmed reviewed tool
effects are attached to that run before the delivery layer acts.

The batch may contain multiple direct-chat messages. These messages are a single
conversation turn, not independent tickets. Pi should decide whether the
latest unread batch as a whole requires a response and should cover every
important item in one reply when needed.

## Retrieval

Before answering substantive questions, Pi can use only the tools exposed by
the reviewed extension:

1. `workspace_read`, `workspace_search`, and `workspace_list` inside configured
   read roots, with realpath/symlink escape checks and bounded output.
2. `graphify_read` for the installed Graphify `query`, `explain`, and `path`
   operations only. Pi never receives a general shell fallback.
3. `execute_reviewed_read` for DWS commands whose exact installed schema effect
   is `read`.
4. `download_dingtalk_image` for DingTalk robot image download codes; media-ID
   downloads are also converted into image tool content by the reviewed DWS
   adapter, without exposing signed URLs.
5. `execute_reviewed_write` only on authorized non-dry-run Direct Agent paths,
   and only when installed metadata classifies the exact command as a
   non-destructive write that does not require product-level user confirmation.
6. Friday Memory read/write tools when the reviewed bridge, Connector URL, and
   local API key are configured. Memory scope comes from authenticated ACL;
   `user_id`, `graph_id`, and `graph_ids` are forbidden.

Lark, Xiaoqing, Exa, arbitrary bash, general file writes, authentication, and
package-management commands are not exposed to Pi.

Replies must not expose local file paths, source citations, session ids, or
tool output details.

## Privacy

The decision schema classifies each message as:

- `general`
- `internal_personnel`
- `external_candidate`

Internal personnel discussions are sensitive and are answered only when the
current conversation participants and configured responsibility rules make the
recipient appropriate. Third-party personnel details in an unrelated direct
chat are refused or handed off. External candidate discussions require trusted
candidate, role, and department context; Xiaoqing-only facts remain unavailable
until a reviewed tool exists.

## Handoff

If the sender asks for the real human, rejects the automated response, or asks
the agent to claim a real-world action that only the human can perform, the
decision should be `handoff_to_human`.

Handoff sends a short acknowledgement in DingTalk and uses DING to notify the
operator. If DING is unavailable, it falls back to the local Chrome notification
bridge so the acknowledgement is not marked failed just because the operator
alert channel is exhausted. The handoff remains active until the worker observes
a real manual reply from the operator in the same conversation. Live runs send a
local pause notification when new unread messages arrive during active handoff;
dry-run checks suppress that pause notification because they intentionally do not
mark messages as seen.

## Audit

Every attempt is stored locally, including:

- trigger message
- action
- draft and final reply
- send status and send error
- audit summary
- documents and tool events used for review
- Pi session id and transcript line range when available
- reviewer feedback and corrected reply

The audit summary is a concise explanation of evidence and applied rules. It is
not hidden chain of thought.

## Meeting Alignment

Meeting follow-up is an independent producer/consumer pipeline inside the same
`com.ceo-agent-service.main` process. There is no separate cron job or launchd
plist. The producer combines AI Minutes metadata with one uniquely matching
calendar event, so a job is eligible only when Derek attended and the meeting
has explicitly ended for at least ten minutes.

The agent remains silent unless it finds a material viewpoint disagreement or a
need for `Derek 的观点输出解读`. An aligned disagreement requires explicit
agreement, commitment, or consistent restatement by the relevant sides. For an
unresolved disagreement the output includes the parties' views and reasons plus
one or more minimum-sufficient tradeoff questions whose answers can directly
produce alignment. A disagreement that becomes aligned still produces the one
meeting follow-up; final alignment does not convert it to `no_action`. Derek's
explanation may use historical cases and the work profile only to clarify a view
that was actually expressed in the meeting. Work-profile source identifiers must
remain exact so the service can audit them.

The service persists a discovery activation timestamp. Before startup recovery,
all pre-activation jobs with no send evidence are baselined to terminal
`no_action`, including work that an older process had already claimed. This
prevents deployment-time recovery from analyzing or sending historical meetings.

Recordings shorter than ten minutes are excluded before calendar matching and
queue creation. Actual candidate interviews are excluded by the agent after it
reads the full meeting source; recruiting planning or hiring-requirement
discussions are not interviews. The bounded `replay-recent-meetings` command can
explicitly reopen selected unsent historical `no_action` jobs without changing
the activation watermark or reopening confirmed sends.

For multi-party delivery, the agent must use live DingTalk evidence to select a
group that clearly owns the business, decision, or follow-up action. Topic
similarity, participant overlap, or recent activity alone is not enough. The
delivery layer verifies that the selected first-ranked candidate is a sendable
group, but it does not require the group-member set to equal the participant
set. Multi-party meetings default to group delivery. The agent instead selects
the uniquely identified calendar creator for direct delivery when the content
is private or when a complete group search finds no sendable owning group. The
message is limited to what that recipient needs. A DWS read or network failure,
incomplete group metadata, or a missing or ambiguous creator keeps the job
retryable and cannot authorize direct delivery. A 1:1 meeting sends directly to the other participant. When an ad-hoc call has no matching
calendar event, it is treated as 1:1 only when the complete transcript contains
exactly Derek and one uniquely resolved employee; otherwise it remains
unqueued. No DING or reaction is added by this workflow.

Real mentions default to meeting participants. Non-participants can be mentioned
only when the meeting transcript explicitly says the task is theirs, assigns
them ownership, or asks them to confirm or follow up. Otherwise their name may
appear in the message body as context, but the delivery layer will not resolve
it into a DingTalk @ mention.

Every sent meeting follow-up starts with a deterministic source header:
`【会议跟进】<meeting title>（<meeting time>）`. The header is added by the
delivery executor, so the sent message, stored final message, and local
notification preview all identify the same source meeting.

After delivery is confirmed as `sent`, the workflow reuses the reply agent's
local/Chrome notification bridge. The notification contains the DingTalk
`openConversationId`, so clicking it opens the group or direct conversation.
Ambiguous sends do not notify until status reconciliation confirms success.
Meeting attempt details reuse the reply-agent audit view: the page emphasizes
the Pi tool-use timeline, including reviewed local, Memory, and DingTalk
calls, instead of leading with raw source or decision payloads.

The queue persists analysis before delivery. `no_action` is terminal;
`ready_to_send` is persisted before any external send; `sent` records delivery.
Retryable failures use `retry` plus `available_at`; invalid persisted source or
delivery evidence and queue invariant violations use `failed`. Pi decision
schema and historical-source protocol violations are treated as retryable
model-output failures before the bounded attempt limit. An ambiguous send with
an `openTaskId` is reconciled by status lookup only, with bounded backoff and no
resend. In dry-run mode the consumer may analyze a job but does not claim
`ready_to_send` delivery.

Every Pi invocation appends an immutable `meeting_alignment_run`. The History
page merges these runs with reply attempts in one globally chronological feed,
including common search, status filters, pagination, event chart, detail view,
and Pi-session related history.

## Task Summary

The task summary system is project-centered, not inbox-centered. It records
company management items, business projects, important operating matters, and
action items that need owner attention. Obvious one-off conversations should not
be promoted into durable projects.

Each processed conversation can enqueue a compact Work Item with:

- `summary`
- `project_name`
- source conversation or document metadata
- owner hints
- timestamps

The task agent owns fact extraction. It receives BM25 project candidates built
from the Work Item summary and project name, then decides whether to update an
existing `work_project` or create a new one. If retrieval finds no stable
candidate, or candidates are present but the agent judges them mismatched, the
prompt allows the agent to recover context through DWS conversation reads or
Memory Connector. New projects should use `memory_recall` for historical
background before creation. If a stable project name still cannot be recovered,
the agent should generate a clarification follow-up instead of creating a vague
project.

`work_projects` store:

- title and category
- `background`
- owner, status, priority, risk level, source conversation
- `next_step`
- `facts`: a list of `description`, `source`, `created`, and `updated`

Supported categories are `management`, `strategy`, `projects`, `marketing`,
`research`, `dev`, `product`, `recruiting`, `sales`, `finance`, `admin`, `HR`,
and `other`.

TODOs live under projects. Due dates and priority are inferred from the concrete
context and OKR pressure rather than copied mechanically. P0/P1/P2 work should
normally become same-day, three-day, or same-week follow-up pressure when the
source material does not give a clearer deadline.

The `/tasks` audit UI is project-first. The list page shows the active project
queue, project status, category filtering, Priority/Risk sorting, TODO checklist
preview, open TODO ratio, real-time full-text search over project and TODO
context, and paginated navigation. Each project links to `/tasks/{project_id}`,
where the detail page shows project background, facts, all TODOs with DDL and
owner, project updates, and follow-up records.

Completion can be inferred automatically from later messages, meetings, or
documents when the evidence is explicit. If an item is due and still open, the
task follow-up path sends the drafted question when live sending is enabled. It
uses the originating group only when that group conversation is known; otherwise
it sends a direct message to the resolved owner. Risk annotations on the draft
are audit context only and do not create a separate approval gate. Drafts more
than seven days past due are skipped instead of sent, because their context is
too stale for a useful reminder. Owner replies then enter the existing CEO reply
path, so follow-up does not need a separate reply engine.

## Safety Defaults

- `CEO_NOT_SEND_MESSAGE=1` by default. `CEO_DRY_RUN` remains a compatibility
  alias for older scripts.
- Runtime state lives under `data/` and is ignored by Git.
- Live sends require explicit opt-in.
- Task follow-up commands are send-capable commands and therefore use the same
  live-send guard as normal reply delivery.
- Local task source scanning is limited to the configured `CEO_WORKSPACE` path.
- DingTalk media/calendar placeholders and DingTalk internal link-only cards are
  skipped before Pi, except approval/OA links.
- OA approval cards and reminders are routed to the OA handler. The handler uses
  the structured Pi runner with the reviewed OA skill injected,
  records the Pi session, tool events, approval URL, approval action,
  approval remark, and action result on the existing reply attempt audit row,
  and does not create a separate OA audit page.
- When a later attempt handles the same OA trigger, the older attempt detail
  presents the later OA result in its primary status area and links to that
  attempt. The older row's stored status remains unchanged as audit evidence.
- The OA handler may use authorized DingTalk OA API detail reads when DWS does
  not return complete approval detail. Secrets and signed URLs must not be
  written to logs, SQLite, audit summaries, reports, or DingTalk replies.
- See `docs/message-routing-rules.md` for the full message-type inventory,
  implemented regexes, candidate regexes, and message types that should remain
  agent-reviewed.
